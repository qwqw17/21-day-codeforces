Codeforces problem solving 21 day challenge.

In this covid-19 phase just like many people my productivity also increased but now-a-days my productivity is going to the lowerside.
So, I figured out that what I need to boost my productivity is a __nicely set goal and an accountability partner.__

So, I decided to do a 21-day challenge wherein I will do:-
1. 7 codeforces 1800-1900-2000 problems daily.
2. 1 virtual / rated contest everyday.
3. 1 hour of rapid solving of simple codeforces problems daily.
	
I will be updating my daily progress in this readme file.
And I will use the linkedin post for accountability of my everyday work (  ).

The goal of this 21-day challenge is not increasing my ratings but to make a daily habit of solving problems.- 
Hoping that all of you will help me in this journey.
